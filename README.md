- Dataset Preparation: Includes scripts and tools for preprocessing the data.
- Model Development: Implements machine learning models for spam detection, including training and evaluation.
- Deployment: Provides instructions and resources for deploying the trained model.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: Contains datasets and data preprocessing scripts.
- `models/`: Includes scripts for model architecture and training.
- `evaluation/`: Scripts for evaluating model performance.
- `deployment/`: Resources and instructions for deploying the trained model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and project details.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies required to run the project.

## Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:
